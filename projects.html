              I built this RESTful API using flask in collaboration with 1 other
              backend software engineer from Moringa. I particularly worked on
              the Models and relationships for the users, doghouses, and
              reviews. In this project, the user and doghouses highlight one to
              many relationships. The migrations were carried out using alembic.
              A user can create several doghouses accounts and a review can
              belong to a user and a doghouse. the form validations were done
              using FLASK-WTF on all input. The patch, delete, and put
              functionalities were all created for the routes. Check it out (you
              can navigate to /server, /doghouses, /reviews):

              I built this RESTful API using flask. the three model classes
              include Restaurant, Pizza, and Reviews. In this project, the pizza
              and Restaurant highlight one to many relationship. The migrations
              were carried out using alembic. A Restaurant can have several
              pizza and a review can belong to a pizza and a restaurant. I added
              validations and constraints to keep the database safe. The patch,
              delete, and put functionalities were all created for the routes.
